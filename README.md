# Safe Skills (Aegis)

A trust check that runs **before** an AI agent or developer loads an agent **skill** (a `SKILL.md`).
Every skill has a human‑readable name (ENS) whose records pin the exact content hash of its
reviewed file. A skill is reviewed by an LLM inside a Chainlink TEE; the verdict is written back to
the ENS name. Before installing, the consumer resolves the name, **re‑hashes the file locally**, and
the `gate()` blocks on any mismatch, failing/ missing verdict, or revocation — and a **Ledger**
signature authorizes the install.

> Canonical design: [ADR-001-aegis.md](./ADR-001-aegis.md). Parallel-work lanes:
> [OWNERSHIP.md](./OWNERSHIP.md). `PLAN.md` is superseded.

The **core logic is pure and chain‑agnostic.** Everything that touches a chain, a wallet, or a TEE
sits behind an interface ("port") with a mock adapter today and a real adapter later. Swapping
mock → real is an env flag, never a code change in `core` or the apps.

## Layout

```
apps/
  web/           Next.js explorer + /verify + read API route handlers (the ONE Vercel app)
  cli/           `safeskills` CLI: check / install / --no-ledger
  cre-workflow/  Chainlink CRE review job (DON-deployed / local runner — not hosted)
packages/
  safeskill/     @aegis/safeskill — the agent SDK + `safeskill` CLI: onboard (signer + policy) → gate skills (auto-approve / Ledger override / block)
  core/          @aegis/core     — types, ports, gate() + hashSkill (pure) + testing/ contract suites
  adapters/      @aegis/adapters — one module per port: mock (default) + real (stubbed) + contract test
  chain/         @aegis/chain    — viem clients, generated ABIs, addresses
  contracts/     Foundry project — SubmissionRegistry.sol (+ legacy AttestationRegistry/Bonding)
tooling/         shared eslint + tsconfig
```

Dependency rule: `apps/*` and `@aegis/adapters` may import `@aegis/core`; **adapters never import
each other**. `@aegis/core` imports nothing with I/O (only `@noble/hashes`).

## Where does each piece of code live? (read this first)

Every integration has exactly one home. The **port** (the typed interface) is in `@aegis/core`; the
**mock** and the **real** implementation sit side-by-side in one adapter module; the **contract
test** that both must pass is in `@aegis/core/testing`. Find your thing in the table, edit only
those files.

### 🔗 Chainlink (CRE review in a TEE)

Two ports + the workflow that drives them. Nothing else touches Chainlink.

| What | File |
|---|---|
| Port: "get an AI verdict" | `packages/core/src/ports.ts` → `ReviewClient` |
| Mock review (scans bytes, flags exfil) | `packages/adapters/src/review/MockReview.ts` |
| **Real Confidential-AI client** (LLM in TEE) | `packages/adapters/src/review/ConfidentialAiClient.ts` |
| Port: "watch the on-chain trigger" | `packages/core/src/ports.ts` → `SubmissionWatcher` |
| Mock trigger (`emit()`) | `packages/adapters/src/watcher/MockWatcher.ts` |
| **Real event watcher** (viem `watchEvent`) | `packages/adapters/src/watcher/ChainWatcher.ts` |
| **The CRE workflow itself** (fetch→hash→review→write) | `apps/cre-workflow/src/workflow.ts` |
| CRE entrypoint / local runner | `apps/cre-workflow/src/index.ts` |
| Review prompt (what the LLM is told to flag) | `apps/cre-workflow/src/workflow.ts` → `REVIEW_PROMPT` |
| Contract tests | `packages/core/testing/contracts/review.contract.ts`, `watcher.contract.ts` |
| Env flags | `AEGIS_REVIEW=chainlink`, `AEGIS_WATCHER=chain` |

### 🔐 Ledger (human-present install authorization)

| What | File |
|---|---|
| Port: address / authorize / verify | `packages/core/src/ports.ts` → `InstallSigner` |
| The signed message (`AuthRequest`) shape | `packages/core/src/types.ts` → `AuthRequest` |
| Mock signer (dev key, no device) | `packages/adapters/src/signer/LocalSigner.ts` |
| **Real Ledger signer** (`@ledgerhq/hw-app-eth`) | `packages/adapters/src/signer/LedgerSigner.ts` |
| Shared sign/recover helpers | `packages/adapters/src/signer/auth.ts` |
| Where the gate enforces it | `packages/core/src/gate.ts` → `unauthorized` branch |
| Gate's below-policy Ledger override | `packages/safeskill/src/client.ts` → `use` |
| Contract test | `packages/core/testing/contracts/signer.contract.ts` |
| Env flag | `AEGIS_SIGNER=ledger` |

### 📜 Policy (what counts as "safe enough")

| What | File |
|---|---|
| Policy type (`requireVerdict`, `maxRiskScore`) | `packages/core/src/types.ts` → `Policy` |
| Where the policy is **enforced** | `packages/core/src/gate.ts` → `gate()` |
| The default policy values | `packages/adapters/fixtures/registry.seed.json` → `"policy"` |
| How it's loaded / handed to the gate | `packages/adapters/src/seed.ts` → `defaultPolicy`, `factory.ts` |

### 🌐 ENS registries (names, pins, verdicts)

| What | File |
|---|---|
| Port: resolve a name → pin + verdict + owner | `packages/core/src/ports.ts` → `SkillResolver` |
| Port: write `safeskills.verdict` to a name | `packages/core/src/ports.ts` → `VerdictWriter` |
| Mock resolver / mock verdict writer | `packages/adapters/src/resolver/MockResolver.ts`, `verdict/MockVerdictWriter.ts` |
| **Real ENS v2 resolver** (`getEnsText`/contenthash) | `packages/adapters/src/resolver/EnsV2Resolver.ts` |
| **Real ENS v2 verdict writer** (CRE grant) | `packages/adapters/src/verdict/EnsV2VerdictWriter.ts` |
| The record shape (`pin`, `node`, `verdict`, `owner`) | `packages/core/src/types.ts` → `SkillRecord` |
| viem clients / chain addresses / ABIs | `packages/chain/src/` |
| Naming model (`weather.acme.safeskills.eth`) | [ADR-001-aegis.md](./ADR-001-aegis.md) §2 |
| Contract tests | `packages/core/testing/contracts/resolver.contract.ts`, `verdict.contract.ts` |
| Env flags | `AEGIS_RESOLVER=ens`, `AEGIS_VERDICT=ens` |

### ⛓️ On-chain submission (the fee that triggers the CRE)

| What | File |
|---|---|
| **The contract** (`SubmissionPaid` event, fee gate) | `packages/contracts/src/SubmissionRegistry.sol` |
| Its tests | `packages/contracts/test/SubmissionRegistry.t.sol` |
| Event → typed `SubmissionEvent` | `packages/core/src/types.ts` → `SubmissionEvent` |
| Web submission UI (`/submit`, pay the fee) | `apps/web/app/` — _not built yet; add `app/submit/page.tsx`_ |

### ☠️ The malicious / poisoned skill (the demo headline)

| What | File |
|---|---|
| **The poisoned `SKILL.md`** (reads `~/.aws/credentials`, POSTs to evil.io) | `packages/adapters/fixtures/poisoned.md` |
| The clean counterpart | `packages/adapters/fixtures/clean.md` |
| Which skill is poisoned vs verified | `packages/adapters/fixtures/registry.seed.json` (`exfil.…` = poisoned) |
| What the detector looks for | `packages/adapters/src/review/MockReview.ts` → `POISON_MARKERS` |
| Engine-level poisoned fixtures (unit tests) | `packages/core/src/__tests__/fixtures.ts` |
| See it blocked end-to-end | `node packages/safeskill/dist/cli.js check exfil.acme.safeskills.eth` |

### 📄 The SKILL.md content + verdict (the data model)

| What | File |
|---|---|
| Hashing a skill (`sha256:<hex>`) | `packages/core/src/hash.ts` → `hashSkill` |
| Fetching the bytes (IPFS / file / mock) | `packages/adapters/src/fetch/` |
| The verdict shape (`status`, `riskScore`, …) | `packages/core/src/types.ts` → `Verdict` |

> Rule of thumb: **interface → `core/src/ports.ts`** · **mock + real → `adapters/src/<port>/`** ·
> **test → `core/testing/contracts/`** · **on-chain → `packages/contracts/`** · **fixtures/demo
> data → `adapters/fixtures/`**.

## Quick start

```bash
nvm use            # Node >= 24
pnpm install
pnpm turbo build lint typecheck test   # all green
```

### `safeskill` — the SDK + CLI your agent runs

`@aegis/safeskill` is the agent-facing tool. It has **two parts**: (1) **onboard** — hook up a
signer (Ledger optional) and set a customizable **policy**; (2) **gate** — before loading any skill
it resolves the skill's verdict from the **ENS registry**, re-hashes the file locally, and decides
**auto-approve / needs-override / blocked** per your policy. Below-policy skills require a **Ledger
signature override**; a tampered file is always blocked. It runs offline against a hardcoded demo
registry with zero chain config.

```bash
# build it once
pnpm --filter @aegis/safeskill build

# from the repo, the CLI is:  node packages/safeskill/dist/cli.js <cmd>
# (or `npm i -g @aegis/safeskill` to get the `safeskill` binary on your PATH)
alias safeskill="node $PWD/packages/safeskill/dist/cli.js"

# 1) ONBOARD — set a policy (auto-approve passing skills ≥ 70% security; below → Ledger override).
#    --local uses a dev key so the demo runs with no device; --ledger uses a real Ledger.
safeskill onboard --local --min-security 70
#    other ways to set policy:  --preset strict|permissive   --policy ./my-policy.json
safeskill policy            # show the active ruleset    ·    safeskill policy --presets

# 2) GATE — the registry + the decision the policy makes for each skill
safeskill list

# check one skill (resolve ENS → re-hash → decide; no install)
safeskill check weather.acme.safeskills.eth        # AUTO-APPROVE (97% security)

# use = check + install. auto-approve installs with no human; below-policy asks the signer.
safeskill use weather.acme.safeskills.eth          # AUTO-APPROVE → installed, no signature
safeskill use sync.evilcorp.safeskills.eth         # NEEDS OVERRIDE (verdict fail) → Ledger signs
safeskill use tampered.acme.safeskills.eth         # BLOCKED — a signature can't override tampering
```

**Custom policy** is plain JSON (ordered rules, first match wins; `--policy ./file.json`):

```json
{
  "name": "trust-acme-only",
  "rules": [
    { "publisherNotIn": ["acme.safeskills.eth"], "action": "blocked" },
    { "minSecurityRating": 70, "verdictStatus": "pass", "action": "auto-approve" }
  ],
  "default": "needs-override"
}
```

**SDK** (what an agent imports):

```ts
import { Safeskill } from "@aegis/safeskill";

await Safeskill.onboard({ signer: "ledger", minSecurityRating: 70 }); // part 1
const ss = await Safeskill.load();
const result = await ss.use("weather.acme.safeskills.eth");           // part 2
if (!result.installed) throw new Error(result.error);                  // fail-closed
```

Full docs + the policy model: [`packages/safeskill/README.md`](./packages/safeskill/README.md).
`AEGIS_RESOLVER=ens` / `safeskill onboard --ens` swaps the demo registry for real ENS v2 on Sepolia.

### Web explorer (deployed at [eth-global-nyc-2026.vercel.app](https://eth-global-nyc-2026.vercel.app))

```bash
pnpm --filter web dev   # http://localhost:3000  — registry, artifact detail, /verify
```

To deploy the web app to Vercel:

1. Push to `main` (auto-deploys via git integration)
2. Or run locally: `vercel build && vercel deploy --prebuilt`

Requires the Vercel project's **Root Directory** set to `apps/web` in the dashboard for optimal Turborepo support.

### Contracts

```bash
cd packages/contracts && forge build && forge test
# regenerate TS ABIs into @aegis/chain:
pnpm --filter @aegis/chain generate
```

## The seam (mocks → real)

Every adapter defaults to a mock so the repo runs with **zero chain config**. Flip a flag in
`buildAdapters` (`packages/adapters/src/factory.ts`) to reach a real adapter — the ones not yet
wired throw `NotImplementedError` with a `TODO(...)` marker, proving the seam exists:

| Flag | Stub |
|---|---|
| `AEGIS_SIGNER=ledger` | `adapters/src/signer/LedgerSigner.ts` |
| `AEGIS_FETCHER=ipfs` | `adapters/src/fetch/IpfsFetcher.ts` |
| `AEGIS_REVIEW=chainlink` | `adapters/src/review/ConfidentialAiClient.ts` |
| `AEGIS_WATCHER=chain` | `adapters/src/watcher/ChainWatcher.ts` |

`AEGIS_RESOLVER=ens` and `AEGIS_VERDICT=ens` are already wired to real ENS v2 on Sepolia — that's
what powers the web explorer.

Flags (see `.env.example`): `AEGIS_RESOLVER` `AEGIS_FETCHER` `AEGIS_SIGNER` `AEGIS_REVIEW`
`AEGIS_VERDICT` `AEGIS_WATCHER`. Each real adapter must pass the same `*.contract` suite its mock
passes (see [OWNERSHIP.md](./OWNERSHIP.md)); they are intentionally **stubbed** for now.

## gate() order

`gate()` checks, first failure wins: fetched hash == pin → verdict present (if required) →
verdict.reviewedHash == pin → verdict passed → riskScore within policy → not revoked → authorized
(the Ledger gate).
